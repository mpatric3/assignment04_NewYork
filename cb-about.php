            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I was born in Farmington, New York. Farmington is a town located in the northern part of Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 11,825 at the 2010 census. Farmington is about twenty-five miles southeast of Rochester, New York. The town was named after Farmington, Connecticut. Farmington was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The town was formed along with its county in 1789, and settlement of the region began the same year. Many of the early settlers were Quakers from Berkshire County, Massachusetts. In 1824, Arthur Power left Farmington with two of his sons and other Quakers to found Farmington, Michigan. The Farmington Quaker Crossroads Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The land, at an average elevation of 600 feet above sea level, is compressed by the Wisconsin glaciation and slopes from an elevation of 700 feet at the southern border with the town of Canandaigua, to 500 feet at the north boundary with the town of Macedon. The land comprises drumlins and eskers. Other than streams and ponds, there are no major water landmarks. Public drinking water is provided by treated water piped from Canandaigua Lake. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.5 square miles (102 km2), all of it land. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes across the town. New York State Route 332 is a north-south highway, and New York State Route 96 is an east-west highway. The north town line is shared by the town of Macedon in Wayne, County.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>My first job was at BJ’s Wholesale Club, near Eastview Mall. I was a cashier, and I worked there the summer between Junior and Senior year. I worked there for about 7 months, but during the winter of Senior year, working was taking its toll on my schoolwork and college search. I quit without giving two weeks’ notice, so I never write them as a reference when I apply for jobs.</p>

                <p>The next summer, before college, I worked at Family Dollar in Farmington. I applied for this job because I thought that, being a smaller store, it would be faster paced than my job at BJ’s, where I spent hours standing with no customers checking out, but unable to do anything other than stay in my aisle. At Family Dollar, I was a cashier, but was also in charge of stocking, cleaning, and to a certain extent, stopping theft.</p>
