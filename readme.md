Assignment 4: New York

Information Architect: Amber Williams
	Created HTML template. Chose to use files from Team Granada containing profiles of computer science majors as the three students who are similiar and the profile of Olatunde Oshunlaja from Team Phoenix since his major is Business, different from computer science.
	Please ignore all internal comments regarding structure that may have been missed. Structure comments applying to page layout and suggestions will be located here.
	Comments:
		The home page should have small snippets of each individual. The computer science majors should be groups together with a seperation between the business major to differiniate them. The heading should notate the difference of the majors (i.e. 3 comp sci and a business major). Each profile should contain an identifying picture that is clickable to their expanded profile/respective pages. 
		Each profile should have only 2 sections (about and work exprience). Intial roles from Granada profiles have been deleted.
		Article is about each person.
		Aside is each person's work experience.
		These sections should correspond with each other in a fluid reading format within each profile page. About should be read first and work experience should be read second. Each page should consist of an identifying photo that is the same deminisions and location for each respective profile page.
		Font and typeface should be easy to read not crampt. Respective headings should be large, bold, and similiar yet different font.
		The web form should inculde a space for "name", "email", and a comment section for users to write a simple sentence regarding how computer science and business interconnect in careers. This form should be listed on the home page.
		The profile page for the business student should differ from the other three pages. Layout should be the same in order to expect similiar flow, but the page should look different (i.e. different color scheme and slightly different font). The headings should also be different. There should be an h1 stating computer science major for the three computer science majors and an h1 stating Business Major for the business major page. These should be centered on the page.

	Designed webpage. The home page s designed in an F layout for easily readability. To indicate that everything that is being seen belongs to the same webpage, everything follows the same color scheme of shade of white, grey, black, and yellow.
	To dentoe the difference between the majors the ocmputer science majors have a white background for their text and the business major has a yellow background that contains their information. I decided not to do different fonts because that would then include three different fonts on the site which would slow it down having to download them. Instead two different fonts were used to portray professionalism and a techy mood. Montserrat was used on the banner and Raleway was used on the rest of the site. In order to help readiblity ont he banner a white shadowk was added to the text. The colors used were also chosen to portray a preofessional and techy modd. The main aspects that were highlighted by the IA is to ensure that there is an obvious difference between the majors and I think that is accomplished by changing which parts of the content are which color, while staying in the same color scheme to ensure consistentncy.
	CSS grid was used to organize information. In the home page CSS grid is used to sepeartae the image from the text. In the webpgaes themselves, they also use CSS grid to seperate the picture from the snippet of text.
	Contrast: the background of the boxes that contain the information of each student are different than the background i.e. computer science majors have a white info box and business majors have a gold info box
	Repition: the article and aside for each student is in its individual box
	Alignment:the home page is an in F layout for readiblity wile the individual webpages follow a z pattern layout
	Proximity: in the individual webpages the text that belongs with the picture and "bullet points" of informaiton is close by to show that it belongs with those objects
