Assignment 4: New York

Information Architect: Amber Williams
	Created HTML template. Chose to use files from Team Granada containing profiles of computer science majors as the three students who are similiar and the profile of Olatunde Oshunlaja from Team Phoenix since his major is Business, different from computer science.
	Please ignore all internal comments regarding structure that may have been missed. Structure comments applying to page layout and suggestions will be located here.
	Comments:
		The home page should have small snippets of each individual. The computer science majors should be groups together with a seperation between the business major to differiniate them. The heading should notate the difference of the majors (i.e. 3 comp sci and a business major). Each profile should contain an identifying picture that is clickable to their expanded profile/respective pages. 
		Each profile should have only 2 sections (about and work exprience). Intial roles from Granada profiles have been deleted.
		Article is about each person.
		Aside is each person's work experience.
		These sections should correspond with each other in a fluid reading format within each profile page. About should be read first and work experience should be read second. Each page should consist of an identifying photo that is the same deminisions and location for each respective profile page.
		Font and typeface should be easy to read not crampt. Respective headings should be large, bold, and similiar yet different font.
		The web form should inculde a space for "name", "email", and a comment section for users to write a simple sentence regarding how computer science and business interconnect in careers. This form should be listed on the home page.
		The profile page for the business student should differ from the other three pages. Layout should be the same in order to expect similiar flow, but the page should look different (i.e. different color scheme and slightly different font). The headings should also be different. There should be an h1 stating computer science major for the three computer science majors and an h1 stating Business Major for the business major page. These should be centered on the page.
