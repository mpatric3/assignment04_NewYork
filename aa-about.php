            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>My name is Alejandro Abreu, and I was born on September 6th, 1995. I was born in Monte Sinai hospital in Manhattan, and a few months later moved to the Bronx where I currently reside. I am from New York City, more specifically, the Bronx. As a youth, I was very active and in love with sports. I spent most of my time at the park or at the gym either playing baseball or basketball. I attended the P.S 220 for elementary school and later moved on the school for Applied Mathematics and Technology, AAMT, for middle school. At AAMT, I played basketball and ran track for the school team. After completing middle school, I moved on and attended high school at A Philip Randolph High School Campus. In high school, I was rejected from joining the varsity baseball team which led me to pursue other sports. This led me to playing Varsity Lacrosse and Bowling. I graduated from A Philip Randolph in Spring 2013. I was accepted to various university but none call out to me like the one that I currently attend. At the moment, I am a senior at the University of Rochester pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am anticipated to graduate from the University of Rochester in May 2018. In my lifetime I have worked in about 5 different location varying from a gym to a school.</p>

                <p>In addition, I joined the Minority Male Leadership Association, MMLA, during my junior year at the University of Rochester. Joining MMLA gave me the opportunity to provide tutoring and support to male students in Public School 19 in Rochester, NY. The graduation rate in Rochester, NY is considerably low compared to other parts of the United States. Our mission was to show students that we were in the same position as them and we were able to overcome the obstacles that they may be going through themselves. I would go to Public School 19 twice a week, and work a group of three students. I was tasked with sitting in their classes and helping them with their work that they did not understand. I would also answer questions they had about my high school and college experience to the best of my abilities. Till this day, I try to keep in contact with the students that I worked with at Public School 19. I hope to provide the scholars in SEO program with the same support that I was able to provide to Luis Avila, Jordan Fletcher, and Thomas Brown at public school 19.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>The first job that I obtained was here at the University of Rochester as a Building Manager at the Goergen Athletic Center. As a building manager at the Goergen Athletic Center, my main responsibilities include ensuring the safety of over 300 students and faculty members using the athletic facility. Building Managers take more than 3 tours a shift around the gym in order to ensure safety and proper usage of our equipment. In addition, a Building Manager is tasked with the responsibility of selling and promoting various membership packages. Finally, we also provide information of building and recreational activities to interested potential and active gym members over the phone or in person.</p>

                <p>I have previously worked with Upward bound as tutor. Upward Bound main focus is to provide high school students with the resources and support they need to get to and through college. As a tutor for Upward Bound, I improved on my communication skills by being responsible for tutoring high school students individually and in small groups who struggled in math. I ensure that every student receives my undivided attention and grasp the material in order to complete their work. When not tasked with tutoring students, I completed an excel spreadsheet on students personal information. Tutoring for Upward Bound has given me some experience in office space environment.</p>
